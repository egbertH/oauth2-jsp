oauth2-jsp
==========

an easy implementation of oauth2.0 using jsp

This is an implementation of oauth2.0 translated from https://github.com/quizlet/oauth2-php.

Like the PHP version, it is straightforward thus easy to understand and test.

And I revised some bug from the php version, so you can establish a runnable experimental enviroment in less than 5 minute, provided that you know how to compile the Java code and have a runing web server.
